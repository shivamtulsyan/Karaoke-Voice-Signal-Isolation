All the input signals and recordings are in Source folders.

Every approach is been carried out in MATLAB.

You can skip entering name of all input signals(Source folder signals are default input) while running the codes but will need to specify the name for output.

All the input, recorded, intermediate, output signals are plotted and storred as "Approach_X.fig" in a sub-folder
You would need matlab to spectate them as well

If you don't have Matlab then you may suffice with screenshots of those plots stored as Fig_X.jpg in a sub-folder

outputs are also attached as "output_X.wav'

Report is also attached in the folder

If you are having any issue in opening any file, contact me I would surely find some alternate
